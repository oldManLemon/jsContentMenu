# jsContentMenu
Simple JS Table of Contents

Why?
-----------

So I could practice my medicore programming skills. Also when googling found overly complex solutions that didn't do what I wanted.

Also didn't want to use jQuery for something I felt could be done with out. 

Also I was using bootstrap for the css. Feel free to use anything else. I was simply toying with the example.
